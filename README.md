Welcome to my Phase 2 Project!

I have used the API from Artic.edu, which is the Art Institute of Chicago, I chose this because I am a fan of art, although I don't own any!

The home page talks a little about the project and explains how you can view the Guestbook and the Art Gallery.

The red Art Institute Logo will take you to the Artic.edu website in a new tab.

On the Guestbook page you can view the Guestbook and sign in, when you browse away from the page and return, your signature will still be there showing that you signed the Guestbook.

On the Art Gallery page, you can choose a popular category from the drop down menu and browse some artwork. You will see the name and title of the artwork.

Thank you for viewing my project and I hope that you enjoyed it!
