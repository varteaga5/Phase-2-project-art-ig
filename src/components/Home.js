            The Art Institute of Chicago's API provides JSON-formatted data as a
            REST-style service that allows developers to explore and integrate
            the museumâ€™s public data into their projects. I am a fan of art, but
            not yet a collector. I decided to use this API to power my project.
            This API is the same tool that powers their website, their mobile
            app, and many other technologies in the museum.
